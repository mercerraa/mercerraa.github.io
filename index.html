        <h1>Geographic information and geodata</h1>
        <p>I work with geodata and GIS, chiefly QGIS. I am a physical geographer, glaciologist, surveyor and jack of all trades.</p>

        <h2>Repositories</h2>
        <p>The repositories found here are for use within Riksantikvarieämbetet, although no restrictions are made. 
            Any QGIS scripts or plug-ins have been written to resolve specific problems and <i>may</i> not be more widely usable. 
            Interpret "may" as "almost certainly won't". The code here is a store or back-up more than anything else.</p>

        <h2>Layer Reverse plugin</h2>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/mercerraa/layer_reverse" target="_blank">The Layer Reverse QGIS plugin</a> is a very simple tool that does one thing and one thing only: it reverses the order of highlighted layers. 
            The tool came about due to a frustation caused by a wms that read in map layers in reverse order, so that text ended up at the bottom and polygons on top.</p>
        <p>To use: highlight layers in the Content pane of QGIS then click the button in the Plugin toolbar. That's it. Nothing more and nothing less.</p>
